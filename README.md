This app was made as part of the beginners/intermediate Scrimba React course. The app is a trivia game where the user must answer questions. 
The goals of the app were to:

(1) get familiar with fetching data from a REST api
(2) get familiar with React concepts like passing and destructuring props, children, and reusable components 
(3) get familiar with State Management, useEffect hooks, conditional rendering, local and unified state, event listeners, and React forms. 
(4) practice implementing SCSS styling based on Figma designs (3) get familiar with continous deployment on Netlify through Github.

The deployed end product can be viewed at:
